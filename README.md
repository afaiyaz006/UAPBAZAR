A simple offline store management app made with javafx developed for learning purpose.This was a group project(assignment) for my java course.

The app has two modes Admin and Customer . In Admin mode new item can be added/updated and also give sale to any certain item.
In Customer mode new item could be purchased by adding them into the cart and total bill of the items could be tracked from the cart.
User can also remove or clear cart if the customer decides to not to buy some of the items they have added to the cart.
